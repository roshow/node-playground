Here's the bug (I think)
Infinite scrolling and such don't play nice with bootcamp's scrollspy stuff.
So.
Not sure what to do right now other than fix the 'mark read' and 'mark unread' buttons. That may lead to so inadevertant fixes of this stupid, stupid code!
There's a solution, I'm not remmbering right now...

TODO

* Updated README with new config.js info
* Create a default user to run app w/o Google OAuth
* Articles:
	* Constructor with only relevant data to save db space
	* Call for articles: 
		* What combination of pulling from the db and making a call to the XML?
		* In groups of 10 articles.
	* How to handle read & unread?
	* Starred?
* Feeds:
	* Constructor flexible to use OPML from Google Reader but also metadata from feedparser
	* Adding/subscribing to a new feed

BUGS

* http://cdn.cad-comic.com/rss.xml - feed comes in with weird syntax. Google Reader can handle it, so perhaps so can I.
* Dealing with feeds that have died/been removed since the user subscribed (ie, http://www.cheapassgames.com) - mostly an issue for imported subscriptions.
